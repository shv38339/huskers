# Huskers
This is my first project on sorting schedule data from former coach Bo Pelini's tenure at Nebraska. 

#### Summary of files

Here is a quick one sentence summary of each file in this repository.

  * coming soon...

#### Libraries and Data
Here are the following `R` libraries I used in this project.
```{r}
library(googleVis)
library(dplyr)
```

The data comes from the two *.csv files that are in this repository. `BoPelini.csv` is the original data I manually scraped from the web and `BoPelini1.csv` is the tranformed/tidied data set that I used with the `R` package `dplyr` from creator Hadley Wickham. And shout out to the creators of the `googleVis` package as well.
